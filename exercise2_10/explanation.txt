The REQUEST_ORIGIN environment variable had to be
changed, because of the load-balancer that was
reverse proxying frontend to be served from port 80
instead of port 5000. So changing the REQUEST_ORIGIN
from http://localhost:5000 to http://localhost 
made all of the buttons to work again. Neither
Dockerfile needed any changes. This change, however,
does not route the ping requests through the load-balancer
(only the exercise 2.8 /api requests).
