I have this three.js and cannon.js starter project on GitHub that I added a development container option to.
The project can be found here: https://github.com/JarSeal/threejs-starter

You can run the project either locally:
$ npm install
$ npm start

or within a Docker container:
$ docker-compose up

When the project has installed and the source compiled, the app can be viewed at localhost:3000.
The should be box dropping on a plate and with the mouse, the scene can be rotated.
Cheers, enjoy! :)
